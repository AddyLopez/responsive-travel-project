          <h2>New Mexico, home to 11,000 years of human occupation</h2>
          <p>
            The history of New Mexico is based on archaeological evidence,
            attesting to the varying cultures of humans occupying the area of
            New Mexico since approximately 9200 BCE, and written records. The
            earliest peoples had migrated from northern areas of North America
            after leaving Siberia via the Bering Land Bridge. Artifacts and
            architecture reveal the complex cultures of ancient times in this
            region.
          </p>
          <p>
            The very first written records of the region were made by the
            Indians who were half Spanish conquistadors, who encountered Native
            American Pueblos when they explored the area in the 16th century.
            Since that time, the Spanish Empire, Mexico, and the United States
            (since 1787) have claimed control of the area. (Read on

              <h3>Carlsbad Caverns National Park</h3>
              <p>
                Carlsbad Caverns National Park is in the Chihuahuan Desert of
                southern New Mexico. It features more than 100 caves. The
                Natural Entrance is a path into the namesake Carlsbad Cavern.
                Stalactites cling to the roof of the Big Room, a huge
                underground chamber in the cavern. Walnut Canyon Desert Loop is
                a drive with desert views. Rattlesnake Springs, a desert
                wetland, attracts reptiles and hundreds of bird species.

                National Monument near Los Alamos in Sandoval and Los Alamos
                counties, New Mexico. The monument preserves the homes and

              <h3>Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument</h3>
              <p>
                Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument is a U.S. National
                Monument located approximately 40 miles (64 km) southwest of
                Santa Fe, New Mexico, near Cochiti Pueblo. [...] The area owes
                its remarkable geology to layers of volcanic rock and ash
                deposited by pyroclastic flow from eruptions within the volcanic
                field of the Jemez Mountains that occurred 6 to 7 million years
                ago. [...] Many of the layers are light in color, which is the
                origin of the monument's Keresan name. Over time, weathering and
                erosion of these layers has created slot canyons and tent rocks.
