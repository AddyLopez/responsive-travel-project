## Description

A travel website about New Mexico employing advanced responsive web development techniques, plus embedded content from Instagram and Google Maps. It looks good on large screens, tablets, and mobile devices. The site features historical information about New Mexico, cards I created about National Parks and Monuments, a gallery of social media posts, along with a hero at the top and a footer with links at the bottom.

- **_HTML:_** accessible semantic tags, logical ordering, meta description for SEO, alt text for images, titles for anchor links

- Coded in VS Code with tools for a **_professional development workflow, version control, and continuous deployment_**, such as Live Server, Git, GitHub, and hosting on Netlify

## Accessibility Rating

- **_Accessibility rating_** by Lighthouse audit: / for desktops, / for mobile devices.

## Design Spec

This professional design spec inspired the layout of the website. I made improvements where accessibility was not considered by the designer. I also substituted embedded content from Instagram to liven up the photo gallery.
